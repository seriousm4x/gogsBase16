This stylish theme is based on [base16 tomorrow night by chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).

## Getting Started

There are 2 ways of installing this theme. One is server sided, the other client sided.

## Installing

### Server sided

Gogs has an official way of loading custom css. You can find the doc [here](https://gogs.io/docs/features/custome_template).

*   Create a file named custom.css under custom/public/css directory.
*   Paste the content of [gogsBase16.css](gogsBase16.css).
*   Edit file ```custom/templates/inject/head.tmpl``` and add a line ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/custom.css">```
*   Restart Gogs

### Client sided
*   You need to have the [stylus extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) installed in your browser. Get the firefox extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and the chrome one [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).
*   Install [this style](https://userstyles.org/styles/155619/gogsbase16) and change the URL to take effect.
